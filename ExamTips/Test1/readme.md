### ‚úÖ GENERAL TIPS
1. **Understand Core Java Concepts:**
   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, etc.)
   - Java syntax, keywords (`this`, `static`, `final`)
   - Wrapper classes and autoboxing/unboxing

2. **Be Comfortable with Code Reading & Debugging:**
   - Recognize valid vs. invalid Java syntax
   - Interpret class structure, access modifiers, and constructors
   - Analyze code output (especially for arrays and string manipulation)

3. **Know Java File Structure Rules:**
   - One public class per file, filename must match public class name
   - Import and package structure must align with file system

### üìå SECTION A: OBJECTIVE QUESTIONS (30 marks)

**Tips for MCQs (2 marks each):**
- Know the **difference between identifiers and reserved words** (`class` cannot be used as a variable name).
- **Java is case-sensitive** ‚Äì `Main` and `main` are different.
- Know default values for instance variables (`int` defaults to 0).
- Practice questions related to:
  - Data types and initialization
  - Wrapper classes like `Integer`
  - Method headers with arrays
  - File imports and packages

üîë **Key topics:**
- `this` keyword usage
- Output of string methods (`toLowerCase()`, `toUpperCase()`)
- `arr[arr.length - 1]` returns **last element**
- Difference between primitive and reference type behavior when passed to methods

### üß© SECTION B: STRUCTURED QUESTIONS (70 marks)

#### üìò Question 1: Class
- Be able to **implement a class from a UML diagram**
- Implement methods that use conditional logic (like `getRate`)
- Understand how to use constructor, accessors, and void methods
- Know how to **instantiate objects and call methods** in a separate class (like `Test1.java`)

#### üëï Question 2: Enum, Wrapper Classes & Packages and Imports
- Know how to declare enums with constructors and fields
- How to use a getter method
- Loop through `Enum.values()` to print constants and values

- Understand **autoboxing/unboxing**
- Use methods like `Integer.valueOf(int)`, `Integer.parseInt(String)`, `intValue()`, `doubleValue()`
- Know the difference between comparing objects vs. primitives

- Proper use of `package` and `import` statements
- Understand **file organization** and dependencies between classes in different packages

#### ‚ú¥Ô∏è Question 3: Arrays, 2D Arrays, Classes
- Loop through arrays, compare values
- Sum column-wise to get totals
- Use nested loops
- Add elements from each array
- Use constructor and methods
- Count, create, and fill new array with average

### üéØ FINAL TIPS TO SHARE


| Topic | What to Master |
|-------|----------------|
| OOP | Constructors, methods, object use |
| Arrays | Looping, comparisons, total calculations |
| Enums | Fields, constructors, methods |
| Wrapper Classes | Autoboxing, unboxing, manual conversions |
| File Structure | `package`, `import`, and class organization |



### ‚ú® BONUS PREP TIPS
- **Write and test your own code snippets** ‚Äî especially around string manipulation, arrays, and OOP.
- Create a **summary sheet** of key syntax rules, like method headers, array declaration, and enum patterns.
- Practice **past year or sample structured questions** to simulate test conditions.
